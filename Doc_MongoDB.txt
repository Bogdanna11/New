how to find out how processes are running --;

top

get your terminal back : control C

ps aux -- shows all the processes which are running ; 

how to kill the processs 'sudo kill process -id'

how to use piping | to sort out or short list process 
--to research for this -- ;

how to use head  and tail ( if you want to check from the top /bottom)

we used ll /nano / cd 

----

Let's go back to the architecture :

README :
1) Create another VM for our DB: mongodb.
2) Ubuntu 16.04  we will use the same box as app
3) Configure /install mondoDB with correct version;
4) Allow the required access :who is going to access the request 
to access the database:

allow IP of our app machine to connect to our DB.
-we are goinng to do that in our app machine by creating an environment
called DB_HOST.

-cd/etc/ is available here
-sudo nano mangod.conf -- by default it allows access to 127.0.0.1 
with port 27017.

-- in the config file we neeed to edit mongo.conf to allow app ip 
or for the ease of use allow all: not best for production env.



--0.0.0.0 will be allowed in the config file ----

PLAN- DESIGN -DEVELOP ---

once you change anything in the configuration restart Mongo DB
- restart and enable 


COMMON ERRORS :

- DB_HOST not found,created in db
-it needs to be created in the app -- we are sending the request from the 
app to the DB
-could not allow users to connect to DB;

the IP address is hidden --hidden from the users.
and the ssh - which is hidden from the users.

======================================================

How to communicate with DB with the vagrant file:

==========================================
the VM is default at the moment :we naming now the VM
give the name of the machine ;
vagrant ssh



=======================================================

block of code  to use : vragant documentation 


lets create 2 VMS 

=======================

sudo apt-get install mongodb-org=3.2.20 -y


vabragr destry db 
vagrant ssh 


vrabrgtn ssh 





bindIp: 0.0.0.0
