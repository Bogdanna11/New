How to set up nginx  as reverse proxy for my Node js application:

I have already an app running at the address : 192.168.10.100
 the default Nginx placeholder page

I have installed Node.js

I have the application running at port 3000.

Now I  need to set up a way for the users to access it.
I will set up the NGINX web server as a reverse proxy for this purpose.

We will set up the Nginx configuration here : 

/etc/nginx/sites-available/default

sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default

In the server block there is a location /block.

I replace the contents of this block with the following config:
. . .
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}



This configures the server to respond to requests at its root.
My server is available at  192.168.10.100:3000 will send the request to app.js
listening to port 3000 at localhost.

sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl restart nginx
