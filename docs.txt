DOCUMENTATION : 


Bash scripting : 
- create a file called provision.sh
- change permission of this file 'chmod +x provision ( name of the file) 
- first line MUST BE starting with  :#!/bin/bash  
- when linux interpreter starts to read the file and it sees this commnds
it knows that it is a shell script.
( the extenstion .sh & the permission ) 
- update and upgrade
- installed nginx
- start nginx
-'enable nginx'
- checked status
- stoped then started
- we create this file in the VM 
- vagrant status
- vagrant ssh
- vagrant destroy
- vagrant up
- vagrant ssh
- sudo apt-get update -y

CREATING A FILE IN THE VIRTUAL MACHINE: 

sudo nano provision.sh

Inside of the file :
#!/bin/bash
#update
sudo apt-get update -y
#upgrade
sudo apt-get upgrade -y
#install nginx
sudo apt-get install nginx -y
# start nginx
sudo systemctl start nginx
#enable nginx
sudo systemctl enable nginx


Save it : ctrl + X /y -enter

Checking the file : cat provision.sh

------------
PERMISSIONS:check permissions command  : ll

provision.sh is not executable file

MAKE THE FILE EXECUTABLE : 

sudo chmod +x provision.sh

CHECK PERMISSION AGAIN : ll


HOW TO RUN THIS FILE ?( THE FILE EXISTS IN THE CURRENT LOCATION ) :

To run our script : sudo ./provision.sh
( OTHERIWSE CHECK THE LOCATION AND PROVIDE IT ) 

-----

sudo systemctl status nginx -- to check the status --;

WE HAVE JUST CREATED A FILE which automates the tasks of installing
the nginx server.

----------

We have a NODE.JS  app which we have to deploy : 
So we have to check for status to see if its' ready to be deployed.


Inside the app /environment/spec-tests we need to run the command:

gem install bundler

budler 

THESE 2 THINGS WE ONLY NEED TO DO ONCE !!!

NEXT we need to run the test : 
rake spec 

this will show us what dependecies need to be installed.

Inside of the Vagrantfile we create a command which will copy eveything from the 
localhost to home/vagrant/app location : 

config.vm.synced_folder ".","/home/vagrant/app"(the new folder) 

default location : pwd --? /home/vagrant

vagrant reload 
ls 
app
cd app ( will be everything from the local host) 
cd app/app/app/app ( here is app.js) 

from inside of the app do : npm install
npm start 

you app is ready and listening to port 3000
